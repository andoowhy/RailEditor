# Unity3D Rail Editor

Create, place and edit grind-able rails for extreme sports games like [Tony Hawk's Pro Skater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hawk%27s_Pro_Skater) or [Jet Set Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Set_Radio).

## Usage:

1. Attach a Rail Component (Rail.cs) to any GameObject.
2. Select the Move Tool, and move rail node(s) to desired position (works with Vertex Snapping)
3. Increase / decrease number of rail nodes as needed in the Inspector (enforced minimum of 2)
4. MeshCollider's mesh is automatically generated!
